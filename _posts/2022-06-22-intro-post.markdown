<h1>Careful I bite. </h1>

Okay not really (unless we’re talking some fresh fruit and veggies) but how could you really know before I said so? …Okay fine it’s probably a pretty safe assumption that any given person is not going to randomly bite you, but what about a dog?

Given these two dogs, Dog A being a 25lb spitz and Dog B being a 100lb boxer, which would you think is more likely to bite you? Probably Dog B, the boxer? I mean the boxer is like solid muscle and I heard he even broke someone’s foot…– but as someone who knows both of these dogs you would be wrong and possibly sporting a nice set of teeth marks from the adorable fluffy spitz who very much internalized the lessons of stranger danger. Whereas the boxer accidently broke his mommy’s foot by stepping on it and is much more inclined to lick someone to death by accident than ever actually demonstrating any brute force.

<h1>Careful i byte</h1>

Okay this one is true, while I might not be able to speak fluently in binary (I do know enough to say that 4 when counting on your fingers is quite rude) and I’ve been in love/involved with Computer Science ever since I took Intro to Programming, as a highschool freshman (many years ago because college makes me feel old). Now you might be still a little confused about the dog example from above, so let’s try it again, this time consider these two people.

Person A often spends their free time making costumes and exploring art supplies and/or bookstores. Person B often spends their free time playing video games and practicing juggling. One of these people is a computer scientist, which person do you believe is more likely to be the computer scientist? Now it might be tempting to once again pick B, but if you’ve caught onto the point I’m trying to prove you may not be surprised to learn that Person A is a computer science major. Although in all fairness Person B is involved in STEAM fields, but has a Master’s in Material Science not CS. 

While it might feel trite, things aren’t always as it seems so it’s important to explore life from a multitude of perspectives in order to truly understand and appreciate the beauty of our surroundings. Hopefully this blog, which I intend on using as a way to catalog my “byte or not byte” experiences, will expose you to new ideas, different perspectives, or inspire you to take a closer look at something you’ve previously dismissed. 

But honestly, I’m not entirely sure where this blog will go in the future, perhaps one could even say I might be byteing off more than I can chew– but that’s part of the making process. Even if this doesn’t go anywhere– because fair warning I don’t really know what I am doing and am definitely figuring this out as I go– I love to make and like any project this far more for me than anyone else.
Nonetheless, can’t wait to see where this journey will take us.

Sincerely, Z
