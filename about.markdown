I am a maker. Creating is an intrinsic part of who I am, and it drives all the work I do regardless of the medium. Whether I am working on a Computer Science project or working on a new Halloween costume, my passion for creating is the driving force. 

I genuinely love to learn and explore new things, I like to work with my hands but also play with problems in my head until all the pieces fall into place. I am constantly experimenting with new materials, techniques, and subjects, because well why not?

Sometimes people look at the breadth of different things I do and have trouble connecting the pieces…okay most people get stuck on the Computer Science + craft projects, piece and kinda just stay there as they try to understand how those could possibly fit together. But they do I promise! 

Although I think it’s something where seeing makes believing a little easier, hence this blog where I’m going to share different projects and passions that shape and inform my life. Every project is unique but since they share the same creator (me) you’ll find there are a lot of similarities in the process/influences/product. Because…

<h4>Creativity is creativity. </h4>

Creativity is being able to see how a series of seemingly simple lines becomes a landscape; creativity is being able to see how a few lines of code becomes a sorting algorithm.
