<h1>Careful i Byte</h1>
<h4> A Place to Explore </h4>
<h4>A Place to Question</h4>
<h4>A Place to Inspire</h4>

A place created by someone who has never really fit in the boxes others have tried to fit them in. Although if I had to choose one, it would be Maker.

<h4>Maker:</h4> 
Someone who looks at the world in their own way and works to share that vision with others whether it be through code, poetry, drawings, or something completely unique onto themselves. 

<h4>I am a proud maker and this is my (virtual) maker space.</h4>

So come and explore the vast expanse of my interests and projects, maybe youâ€™ll discover you byte too!
