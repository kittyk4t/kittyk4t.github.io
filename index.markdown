<h1>Careful i Byte</h1>
A Place to Explore
A Place to Question
A Place to Inspire

A place created by someone who has never really fit in the boxes others have tried to fit them in. Although if I had to choose one, it would be Maker.

Maker: someone who looks at the world in their own way and works to share that vision with others whether it be through code, poetry, drawings, or something completely unique onto themselves. 

I am a proud maker and this is my (virtual) maker space.

This blog is going to start as a place to explore the projects I’ve worked on and the lessons I’ve learned, taking a closer look at the process and challenges that go into the making of a final product. It will also be a place for me to talk about topics that I care about, influencing not only who I am but also how I view the world. Now that sounds super lofty, but really I like to make things and I want to share those things with others.
 
While it might feel trite, things aren’t always as it seems so it’s important to explore life from a multitude of perspectives in order to truly understand and appreciate the beauty of our surroundings. Hopefully this blog, which I intend on using as a way to catalog my “byte or not byte” experiences, will expose you to new ideas, different perspectives, or inspire you to take a closer look at something you’ve previously dismissed. 

So come and explore the vast expanse of my interests and projects, maybe you’ll discover you byte too!
