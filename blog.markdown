This blog is going to start as a place to explore the projects I’ve worked on and the lessons I’ve learned, taking a closer look at the process and challenges that go into the making of a final product. It will also be a place for me to talk about topics that I care about, influencing not only who I am but also how I view the world. Now that sounds super lofty, but really I like to make things and I want to share those things with others.
 
While it might feel trite, things aren’t always as it seems so it’s important to explore life from a multitude of perspectives in order to truly understand and appreciate the beauty of our surroundings. Hopefully this blog, which I intend on using as a way to catalog my “byte or not byte” experiences, will expose you to new ideas, different perspectives, or inspire you to take a closer look at something you’ve previously dismissed. 

So come and explore the vast expanse of my interests and projects, maybe you’ll discover you byte too!
